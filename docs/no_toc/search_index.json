You may have heard the term cloud computing before, and data scientists often talk about working on the cloud. But what exactly is the cloud? Cloud storage refers to data or document storage on the Internet rather than on your personal computer. If you take pictures using your phone and then they are backed up on iCloud or Google Photos, you are using the cloud. Using the cloud for storage is like having an external hard drive (portable storage device) that you don’t ever see and can’t actually hold in your hands. 1.0.1 Cloud computing Cloud computing involves applications and software that run on shared data centers rather than running on the computer sitting in front of you. For data analysis, cloud computing has changed the way we think about working with data, especially when it comes to large datasets. A data analyst no longer needs to spend thousands of dollars to own high-capacity computers to deal with big data because the personal computer no longer has to do all the heavy lifting. Instead, a network of computers (from Amazon, IBM, or Microsoft among many others) will do the work instead. Your local computer will only need to run the interface software, which is often just your Internet browser. In future lessons we will study cloud-based data applications in more detail. 1.0.2 What are the advantages of using the cloud? A major advantage of the cloud is the ability to access your files everywhere, even if you don’t have your personal computer with you. Since storage and applications work over the Internet, they can be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection. An important advantage of cloud storage is that your files are safe even if your computer is lost or damaged. Because your files are not stored on your computer itself, they are safe and available even if your computer is stolen, you spill coffee on your keyboard, or there’s a natural disaster in your area. Moreover, most cloud storage services provide back-up services in case you delete files by mistake. These back-up services allow for accidentally deleted files to be recovered and restored. An advantage of cloud computing is an increase in computing power over what is available on your local machine. Remote machines that are used for cloud computing are more powerful than your personal computer and can do your data analysis much faster. Finally, working with the cloud puts the responsibility of maintaining software on the service provider rather than on you. When running software locally on your personal computer, you need to maintain applications by making sure that they still work and are up to date with the most recent versions. You must download and install the newest version of the software yourself or possibly even pay for a newer edition. With the cloud, service providers make sure the software is well-maintained and running optimally. 1.0.3 What are the disadvantages of using the cloud? The most obvious disadvantage of working on the cloud is that you need an Internet connection to access storage and computing power. You cannot work “offline” away from the Internet. However, with wireless Internet service (wifi) available widely in libraries, coffee shops, and other public places, it’s possible to work on the cloud from almost anywhere! There are also concerns with the privacy and security of data that is stored remotely. Privacy and security are issues that must be addressed by both providers and users of cloud-based services. Service providers need to ensure that the files stored at their data centers are safe and secure. Users need to take advantage of authentication measures and use strong passwords to ensure that no one can gain access to their account. Most major cloud-based service providers do a good job in securing your data. Specifically, their infrastructure is set up so that you can avoid security issues by being serious about protecting your account access information through your choice of password and by using two-factor authentication for logins. Briefly, two-factor authentication is a way of proving your identity to a service provider in two steps. The first step that is by providing a password. The second step involves using a physical object in your possession, such as a phone, to prove your identity. For example, you may also need to enter a code that is sent to your phone during the login process. This means someone would need both your password and physical possession of your phone to access your account. It is good practice to chose two-factor authentication whenever it is offered by a service provider. 1.0.4 Slides and Video What is the Cloud?

E-mail, short for electronic mail, is an important part of the communication picture because of its flexibility. You can write messages of varying lengths, use formatting if you desire, and attach documents as needed. Depending on your particular work situation, email may be your main means of communicating about your work. When using a Chromebook on the cloud, the email application of choice is Gmail. Gmail is a free e-mail service provided by Google that provides users with a gigabyte of free storage for messages and includes the ability to easily search for specific emails. Gmail also automatically organizes related emails into a conversational thread, meaning that a message and all replies to that message are stored together. Gmail has many of similarities with other web-based email clients, such as Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail. If you regularly use email through an internet browser, much of the following will be review. 2.0.1 Accessing your Gmail Inbox Gmail is included with your Google account, so you should already have access to Gmail through the account you set up in your first introductory course. Your email address will be username@gmail.com, where username is the username of your Google account. For example, if your user name is Jane.Doe then your email address would be Jane.Doe@gmail.com. This is one reason to choose an appropriate user name, since this email address will be visible to anyone you communicate with over email! You can access Gmail by going to the address “https://www.gmail.com” or by clicking on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for “Gmail”. If you are not already logged into your account, you will see a prompt similar to the one here. {format: png} After inputting your Google username and password you will be able to see your inbox. If you are already logged into your Google account, you will be brought immediately to your inbox without the need to first log in. {format: png} Your inbox shows you all of the messages you’ve received through Gmail. Messages you have already read are shaded gray, while those you haven’t read yet are white. You can open a message to read it by clicking on the message stripe. By default, Gmail organizes your emails into three groups: Primary, Social, and Promotions. You can switch between these groups using the tabs at the top of the screen. {format: png} The “Primary” tab will contain the majority of the email messages that you will care about reading and responding to. The “Social” tab will contain messages related to social media, such as messages from Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The “Promotions” tab will contain messages that include offers for purchasing products or signing up for services. Gmail uses machine learning to put new messages into the appropriate tab. As mentioned before, the “Primary” tab will be the main focus of using your email as a data scientist. One nice feature of Gmail is that it organizes related emails into a conversational thread. The message indicated by the red arrow is an example of a conversational thread, where an original message and all of its replies are grouped together. {format: png} By clicking on this message, you can see all of the individual messages that make up the email conversation, and can open each individual message by clicking on it. {format: png} 2.0.2 Composing and Sending Emails Let’s say you want to send an email to a client. The first step is to start a new message by pressing the “Compose” button on the top left corner of your inbox. {format: png} A box will pop-up where you can enter the recipient’s email address (in the To field), the subject of the email, and the content of the email. {format: png} You can send an email to multiple people by entering all the emails one after another in front of To. You can also add recipients in the Cc (carbon copy) or Bcc (blind carbon copy) fields by clicking on either of these links to the right of the To area. Recipients who are copied (Cc) will receive the email as if it is addressed to them; this option in usually used if you want them to be aware of the message but aren’t expecting them to take any action or reply. Recipients who are blind copied (Bcc) will receive the message, but their email addresses won’t be visible to other recipients of the email. This option is often used when sending an email to a long list of recipients where you don’t want each individual to see the other people on the email. You should also include a short informative subject in the Subject area so that the recipient will know what the contents of the email are about. This is also helpful later when you may want to search your email to find a particular message. There are also a few buttons in the menu bar at the very bottom of the email box that are very helpful. The attachment button, which looks like a paperclip, can be used to attach a file from your computer (such as an image, a document, or a video) to your email message. {format: png} You can also attach a file from Google Drive to your message by clicking on the Google Drive button, which looks like a triangle. Google Drive is Google’s file hosting service and you will learn more about it in a later lesson. {format: png} You can send attachments up to 25 MB in size through Gmail. If you have more than one attachment, they can’t add up to more than 25 total. If your file is greater than 25 MB, you can instead upload the file to Google Drive and share a link to the file over email instead of including it as an attachment. Other options in this menu bar include inserting a photo (with the picture button), inserting a link (with the chain button), emojis (with the smiley face button), or even sending money (with the dollar sign button). {format: png} There are also many formatting options available for your email message, such as changing the font type and size, bolding text, including bullet lists, and more. These formatting options are similar to those available through Google Docs, which you will see in a later lesson, so we won’t spend time on them now. But you can find these options under the format button, which looks like an uppercase A with a line under it. {format: png} Finally, once you are ready to send your message, click the “Send” button at the bottom left of the message box. If you type an email but change your mind about sending it, you can delete the email by clicking on the trash can button in the bottom right corner of the new message box. {format: png} If you close the new message box without deleting it, it will automatically be saved as a draft message, and you can find it under the “Drafts” link in the list of link on the left-hand side of your inbox. {format: png} 2.0.3 Replying to a message To read an email message, simply click on the message stripe. If you want to reply to the message, you can scroll to the bottom of the message to the reply box. To reply, simply click in the box and start typing your response. After writing your response to the email click the send button and you are done! {format: png} To forward the message to someone else, click on the “Forward” link and type the new recipient’s email address in the “To” area. You can then click in the message box to add a note to the forwarded message. If there is more than one other person on the email, you will also have any option to “Reply to all”, which means that your response will be sent to all the people who were on the original email. Use this option with caution, and only when you need all of the people to see your response. 2.0.4 Searching for specific messages To find a particular email message in your inbox, you can search using the search box at the top of the Gmail screen. Searching your Gmail inbox is very similar to searching the internet using Google. You can search by a word in subject of the email, the name of the person who sent the email, or the content of the email. For example, to find all messages from John Doe, you could type “from:john.everyday.doe@gmail.com” in this search box. To find messages that include the words “cancer data”, you could type “cancer data” in this search box. {format: png} If you click the down arrow next to the search box, you will open a window that allows more specific options, such as searching by either sender or recipient, searching for specific words in the subject line, or searching by whether the message includes or doesn’t include certain words. You can also specify specific dates to search for messages. {format: png} 2.0.5 More specifics on using Gmail We have touched very briefly on some of the basics of using Gmail: accessing your account, sending and replying to messages, and searching for a particular message. There are lots of other features of Gmail that you may want to explore now or at a future time. There are many good beginner tutorials on using Gmail on YouTube.com. Google also has extensive information on getting started with Gmail on their G Suite Learning Center, which can be found at the following web address: https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/gmail/get-started/#!/ In this tutorial, you can find additional information about creating and sending email messages, organizing your inbox, searching your email, and more! 2.0.6 Slides and Video Using Gmail for Email Communications Slides {quiz, id: quiz_02_gmail} 2.0.7 Gmail quiz {choose-answers:4} ?

Google Calendar is a cloud-based time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google. It allows user to quickly schedule meetings and events, and get reminders about upcoming activities. Google Calendar is designed for teams, so it’s easy to share your schedule with others and create multiple calendars that you and your team can use together. 3.0.1 Accessing your Google Calendar Like Gmail, Google Calendar is included with your Google Account. You can access your calendar by going to the address “https://calendar.google.com/” or by clicking on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for “Calendar”. If you are already logged in to your Google account, you will go directly to your calendar. If not, simply log in with the username and password for your Google account. Once you access your calendar, you will see something like this: {format: png} This shows a list of your scheduled events for the week. The shaded column and red line show the current day and time. You can also look at your schedule in a daily, monthly, or yearly view by selecting the appropriate option from the drop-down menu at the top right part of your calendar. To the left of the scheduling window, you can see the different calendars available to be scheduled. You should have a calendar with your name, in this case Jane Doe, and some defaults like Birthdays and Reminders. Each calendar is given a different color on your schedule. We will talk later about organizing your schedule by adding additional calendars. 3.0.2 Scheduling and editing events Right now there is nothing scheduled on this calendar. To create a new event, click on the red button with the plus-sign in the bottom right corner of the page. {format: png} After clicking this button, a new page will be loaded where you can name the event, assign the event start time and end time as well as date, location, and description. {format: png} You can also share the event with others by entering their email addresses in the “Add guests”” section. You can also schedule reminders for you event, which we will talk about a little bit later. After entering all the information the event can be created by pressing the “Save” button at the top. {format: png} Now you can see that the event has been added to your schedule on the appropriate day and time. {format: png} If you need to modify an event after creating it, you simply click on the event in the calendar and then press the “pencil” button. This will re-open the scheduling window for the event. You can make any necessary changes and then click “Save” again. Any changes will also be made in the schedule of those you have invited to your event as guests. {format: png} A short-cut method to creating new events is to simply click on your schedule where you want the event to go. This will open a window where you can enter the name and time of the event. From here you can click “Save” to schedule the event or “More options” to add additional information. This short-cut method is handy for quickly scheduling events where the name and time is all of the information you need. {format: png} 3.0.3 Adding reminders to your events If you want to be reminded about an event in advance, you can schedule notifications for your event. You can do this when you first create your event, or add reminders later. First click on the event in your schedule and then the “pencil” button to edit the event. In the scheduling window, look at the notification section, indicated by the red box. {format: png} You select how you want to be reminded of the event, either by a pop-up notification on your computer screen or through an email to your Gmail account. You also choose how far in advance you want to be reminded, which can be in terms of minutes, hours, days, or weeks. For meetings, you might choose to be reminded 30 minutes before the event, while for a friend’s birthday you might choose a notification 1 day before. For our event, we have choosen to have a pop-up notification reminder 30 minutes before the meeting. You can add a second notification by clicking on “Add Notification” and remove notifications you don’t want by clicking the “X” next to the notification you want to remove. A few additional notes about reminders: If you have the Google Calendar application installed on your mobile phone, pop-up notifications will also appear up on your phone. You can also set the default notifications for a particular calendar to be the same, which you will see in the next section. So, for example, you could set a default that every event would have a pop-up notification 30 minutes before the event. 3.0.4 Creating and editing calendars To help organize your schedule, you can create different calendars for different types of events. For example, you might have one calendar for all work events, a separate calendar for social events, and a third calendar for scheduled work time. When creating an event, you can assign it to a particular calendar. By assigning different colors to your calendars, you can see at a glance which types of events are upcoming. As mentioned before, you can also assign customized default notifications for each calendar. Suppose we want to create a new calendar for social events. To create a new calendar, click on the + sign next to the “Add a friend’s calendar” box to the left of your schedule and select “New calendar.” {format: png} This will open a window where you can customize this new calendar. Give it a name, in this case “Social,” and a description if you’d like. Then click the “Create calendar” link. {format: png} Once your calendar is created, you it will appear under the “My calendars” section to the left of your schedule. (You get back to your schedule by clicking on the back arrow at the top left of the settings screen.) Now you can configure this calendar by hovering over the calendar name and then clicking on the three vertical dots to the left. You can choose a particular color to use for this calendar if you don’t like the one that is automatically assigned. You can also configure the settings for the calendar by choosing the “Settings and sharing” option. {format: png} In the “Settings” window, you can change the name of your calendar and edit the description. You can also share the entire calendar with other people rather than just sharing an individual event. If you scroll down to the “Event notifications” section, you can set up customized notifications for all events in the calendar. To do this, click on the “ADD NOTIFICATION” link and choose the method and time for your default notifications. For example, for social events, you might choose a one-day reminder over email. Now this will be the default notification for all events scheduled on your Social calendar, although you can still adjust the notifications for individual events in this calendar under the individual event settings. {format: png} One thing to remember is that while notifications can be useful, it can be overwhelming to constantly receive them. You should figure out the notification system that works best for you! Here you can see that Jane has the three calendars we talked about set up on her schedule. The blue is her work events, the purple is her social events, and the red is her work plan for the day. She has notifications set for 1 day on social events, 30 minutes on work events, and no notifications on her work plan for the day. Using her calendar to schedule and organize her time helps her stay on task during the day. {format: png} 3.0.5 More specifics on using Google Calendar In this lesson, we have talked briefly about how to create and edit events on Google Calendar, how to create and edit new calendars, and how to use notifications to set reminders for meetings and events. These are the basics of using Calendar to manage your schedule. There are many other features that can be used for managing and tracking your time that you may want to eventually explore. There are many good tutorials for using Calendar on YouTube.com. Google also has extensive information on getting started with Calendar on their G Suite Learning Center, which can be found at the following web address: https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/calendar/get-started/#!/ 3.0.6 Slides and Video Google Calendar Slides {quiz, id: quiz_03_calendar} 3.0.7 Google Calendar quiz ?1 TRUE or FALSE: Sharing calendars is a feature of Google Calendar?

It enables you to store files (including documents, data, images, videos, and presentation slides) online. You can also edit many of these files directly online, without needing to download them to your computer or upload them back to the cloud. One of the major benefits of Google Drive is the ability for multiple people to edit the same files at the same time. This makes Drive a useful tool for collaboration, with is very important to a data scientist. 4.0.1 Accessing your Google Drive account Like Gmail and Calendar, Google Drive is included with your Google Account. You can access your Drive account by going to the address “https://www.google.com/drive/” or by clicking on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for “Drive”. You will see a welcome screen like this. {format: png} Click the “Go to Google Drive” button to be taken to your Drive account. If you are already logged in to your Google account, you will go directly to Drive. If not, you will be prompted to log in with the username and password for your Google account. Here you can see Jane’s Drive directory. She currently has four documents stored on her Google Drive: a presentation in Google Slides, a dataset in Google Sheets, an image, and a document in Google Docs. To open any document from drive, simply double-click on the document itself. {format: png} 4.0.2 Organizing files in Google Drive In Jane’s Drive account, you can see that she simply has each document shown individually without any file organization structure. This is fine when you have only a small number of documents. However, if you use Google Drive to store lots of documents you will need a file structure to keep things organized and to quickly find the documents you need. In general, we strongly suggest that you create folders to keep similar files together. In this course, we will simply go over the basics of organization in Google Drive. You will learn about good practices for organizing files for projects in a later course, which will include how to chose a folder structure and naming conventions for files and folders. First, let’s create a new folder. Click the “New” button in the top left corner of the Google Drive home page and then select “Folder.” A new window will open. Type the name of your folder, in this case “Cancer project,” and click the blue “CREATE” button. {format: png} You can now see this new folder under the “Folders” section of your Google Drive home page. To access the files in this folder, you would double-click on the folder name. {format: png} Now that you have created a folder, you can start adding files to it. Suppose you want to move the Google Slides presentation “Exploratory plots for cancer project” to this “Cancer project” folder. In the Google Drive home page find this presentation file and right click on it. A menu will open; choose the “Move to” option and then select the folder, “Cancer projects,” that you want to move it to. If don’t already have a folder, you can create one in the menu by clicking on the folder icon. {format: png} You can also drag a file to a folder. Just click the mouse button to select a file and while keeping the mouse button pushed down move the file over to the folder and release the button. 4.0.3 Creating files in Google Drive So far we have only moved existing files to a folder. You can create a new file in Google Drive by clicking the “New” button in the top left corner of the Google Drive home page and then selecting the type of file you want to create. You can choose a “Google Doc” for a word-processing document, a “Google Sheet” for a spreadsheet, a “Google Slides” for a presentation, or other choices from the “More” menu. Once you’ve selected your file type, a new window will open with your new file. From here you can begin to edit your file; specific types of Google files will be covered in later lessons. Files in Google Drive are automatically saved to the folder you are in when the file is created. So if you create a new file from your home page, the file will be saved there. If you create a new file the “Cancer project,” the file will be saved to that folder. Remember that you can always move a file to a particular folder as shown before. {format: png} 4.0.4 Uploading files to Google Drive You can also upload files or folders from your computer to Google Drive. To do this, you again click the “New” button in the top left corner of the Google Drive home page and then select either “File upload” or “Folder upload.” Once selected, a window will open that will allow you to navigate to the file or folder you’d like to upload. {format: png} 4.0.5 Deleting Files and folders Deleting files and folders is easy on Google Drive. Simply right-click on the file you would like to delete and choose “Remove” from the menu. Be careful when deleting folders, though! If you delete a folder, all the files in it will be deleted as well. {format: png} You can delete multiple files or folders at once by first selecting them all while holding the Ctrl key. Once selected, you can right-click and delete them with the “Remove” option on the menu. 4.0.6 File Recovery If you do accidentally delete a file or change your mind once it’s deleted, recovering a removed file on Google Drive is straight-forward. Deleted files are moved to the Trash folders within Google drive. To recover a file, simply click on the “Trash” link on the left-hand menu. {format: png} In Trash you can see a list of all the files that you have previously removed. Right-click on the file you want to recover and select “Restore.” The file when they be returned to its original folder on Google Drive. If you’re sure that you won’t need the file ever again, you can clear some storage space by right-clicking on the file and choosing “Delete forever” from the menu. This option is only available within the “Trash” folder. Use this option with caution! By doing this your files will be deleted forever from your drive and can no longer be recovered. 4.0.7 File Sharing One of the biggest advantages of Google Drive is the ability to share files and folders with other people. You can share individual files and folders that you store in Google Drive with anyone by using their email address (preferably their Gmail account). You can allow those people the permission to either edit, comment on, or only view the file. Permission to edit gives the person freedom to delete the file or change it in any way. Permission to view will only allow the other person to read the file, but they won’t be able to change it. Permission to comment allows the other person to insert comments on the file, but they won’t be able to edit the file itself. To share a file or folder, just right click on the file or folder and select “Share” from the menu. {format: png} In the window that opens, enter the email address of the person you want to share the file/folder with and choose whether the person can edit, comment, or only view the content. If for some reason you want to stop sharing a file or folder that you have already shared, right click on the file and choose “Share” again. In the bottom right corner of the window that pops up, click on Advanced. There you’ll see a list of people with whom you’ve shared the file. To the right of each name or email there is an X. By clicking on it, you will remove access of that person to the file. Click “Save changes” when you’ve finished removing access. 4.0.8 Working Offline The main advantage of cloud storage like Google Drive is that all of your files are stored online and are accessible whenever you want them. But what do you do when you don’t have access to the Internet and want to access your files offline? If you know in advance you will be without internet access, you can easily make Google Drive files available offline on your Chromebook. To do so, follow these steps: First, when online, install the Google Docs Offline extension by clicking on ‘Add to Chrome’. If the button says “Added to Chrome,” you’ve already installed the extension. {format: png} Next, go to Google Drive settings and in the “Offline” area, check the box. It might take a few minutes for the offline access setting to turn on. {format: png} You are now ready to work on your files offline! Any changes will sync to Google Drive the next time your Chromebook connects to the Internet. 4.0.9 Storage limit Your Google Drive account comes with 15GB of free storage. If this is not enough space, you can pay for more space: $1.99 per month buys 100GB of storage and $9.99 (as of February 2018) buys 1TB of storage. Note that the free 15GB is shared among all Google services, including Gmail and Drive, so, part of your storage may be used by your email attachments. You can see how much storage you are using in the lower part of the left-hand menu on your home page. There is also a link here to purchase additional storage. {format: png} 4.0.10 Security Google Drive encrypts your data before storing it. Encryption is any method that converts data to to encoded version for security purposes. Drive is encrypted using SSL, the same security protocol used on Gmail and other Google services. However, you’re still responsible for securing your Google account. Two-Step Verification (also known as two-factor authentication), provides an extra layer of security to your account. This requires you to enter your password and on top of that enter a code that is sent to your phone or email. You’ve learned about two-step verification in a previous lesson; we strongly recommend you use Google’s two-step verification to secure your files on Google Drive. {format: png} 4.0.11 More specifics on using Google Drive In this lesson, we have talked briefly about how to create files and folders in Google Drive, as well as how to delete, recover, and share your files. There are many other features of Drive that you may want to eventually explore. There are many tutorials for using Drive on YouTube.com. Google also has extensive information on getting started with Drive on their G Suite Learning Center, which can be found at the following web address: https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/get-started/#!/ 4.0.12 Slides and Video Google Drive Slides {quiz, id: quiz_04_drive} 4.0.13 Google Drive quiz ?1 TRUE or FALSE: “Google Drive is a free service by Google that allows users to upload files without any limit on the size.” TRUE FALSE ?1 TRUE or FALSE: “Google Drive is a free service by Google that allows users to upload files to the cloud.” TRUE FALSE {choose-answers:4} ?2 What is Google’s two-step verification? It is an additional step to increase the security of your Google account. It is a two-step process that increases security on your Google account. It allows users to two more steps in addition to entering their password. It is for Google to shorten the time of logging in. It asks for users’ valid identification such as driver’s license. It is a process that removes the need for a password. It is a two-step process that decreases the security on your Google account. {choose-answers:4} ?3 Which of the following statements is FALSE? Files can’t be accessed offline. Google Drive only allows files to be shared when offline Once files that exist in the trash folder are deleted, they can no longer be recovered. Files can be shared with anyone on Google Drive. Google Drive can store Sheets, Docs, and Slides. Google Drive allows files to be uploaded from your local computer. Google drive allows organization into different folders. {/quiz} "],["google-docs.html", "Chapter 5 Google Docs", " Chapter 5 Google Docs One of the benefits to using Google on the cloud is its suite of document editors, which are completely free to use and accessible anywhere online. One of these editors is Google Docs, which is a web-based word document and text editor. If you’ve ever used Microsoft Word to create and edit documents, then you can think of Google Docs as an online version of Word, since it has many of the same capabilities. In fact, it is compatible with Microsoft Word files (.docx and older) as well as plain text files (.txt). A major benefit of Google Docs over Microsoft Word, however, is the cloud capability. Because documents are edited online, multiple users can format and edit a word document at the same time. Google Docs can be accessed from within Google Drive. To create a new document through Drive, simply click the “New” button in the top left corner of the Google Drive home page and then select “Google Docs.” {format: png} Alternatively, you can go directly to the Google Docs URL https://docs.google.com to create a new document. What’s the difference? Google Drive contains all of the files you have stored on the cloud, including images, spreadsheets, and presentations. Google Docs will contain only your word and text documents, so it can be useful when you only want to work with those types of files. Here’s an example of Jane’s Google Docs page. You can see her recent documents in the bottom part of the screen. The top part, below “Start a new document” is called the TEMPLATE GALLERY, which allows you to quickly create a new document. To create a new document you can choose the blank option or any of the templates available. {format: png} Clicking on the “TEMPLATE GALLERY” link will expand the template options to include “Resumes,” “Letters,” “Personal,” “Work,” and “Education” templates. {format: png} Assuming that you are logged into your Google account, underneath the templates you will see the past documents that are saved on your Google Drive under the “Recent documents”. In Jane’s account, we see only one. Each of them can be opened and edited by clicking on them, which will redirect the current window to the old word document. You can sort by date modified or by title by clicking on the “A-Z” button. {format: png} 5.0.1 Auto-save feature and working offline One of the most convenient aspects of Google Docs (and all document editors on Google Drive) is its auto-save feature. As soon as the application detects a change in the file, it will automatically save without any prompt from the user. This means you don’t need to remember to save your progress as you work. You do not need to worry about losing progress when the power goes out, the internet disconnects, or even when a computer breaks down. If a stable internet connection is an issue or if you plan to work offline, Google Docs offers an offline mode that saves the word documents to the local computer. Even in offline mode, Google Docs will automatically save changes. To turn on offline mode, click on the menu button in Google Docs and then click on “Settings.” {format: png} Toggle the “Offline” switch to on. {format: png} Offline mode for Google Docs will also be applied to Google Sheets and Google Slides. 5.0.2 Working in Google Docs Now that we’ve covered how to access Google Docs and where to find Google Docs you’ve previously created, we’ll discuss a few features that you can use within Google Docs. Additionally, many of these features can be used across Google products, so once you master them in Google Docs, you can also apply them in Google Sheets and Google Slides. If you’ve worked in Google Docs or Microsoft Word previously, this will likely be a review. However, we want to make sure that all the features within Google Docs that you’ll use regularly are covered in this lesson. To get started, again, you’ll want to go to Google Docs and click on Blank to open up a blank document. {format: png} You will then see a blank document, as shown here. In addition to the document itself, there are many formatting options available through menus in the document editor. {format: png} 5.0.2.1 Formatting Font Within Google Docs, once you start typing information into your document, you may want to change the way that your text looks. This is called “formatting” your text. You can format the text by: changing the font changing the size of the font making the font bold, italicized, or underlined changing the color of the font All of these changes to text can be accomplished using the options on the toolbar within Google Docs. {format: png} To use these options from the toolbar, you’ll begin typing within Google Docs. Then, for any text you want to format, you will simply highlight the text, and click on the appropriate option from the toolbar. In this example, we would type “Document Title” into the Google Doc. To make the title bold, underlined, and larger, we would just highlight the text, click on the bold symbol and the underline symbol. While the text is still highlighted you would click on the drop down “Font size” menu, and click on a larger number (here, we’ve selected ‘24’). Now your text will be just as you want it. The same process can be used to change the font and to change the color of the font. {format: png} 5.0.2.2 Aligning Text What if, in addition to formatting the text itself you wanted to alter where the text was on the page? To change this, you can use other options from the toolbar. These buttons can be used to alter the alignment in four different ways: left-aligned - aligned on the left side of the page center-aligned - aligned in the center of the page right-aligned - aligned on the right side of the page justified - aligned so that the text is flush with both the left- and right-sides of the page To use these options, again, you’ll highlight the text you would like to align and then click on the appropriate alignment option: {format: png} 5.0.2.3 Inserting a List In addition to changing how some text is formatted or where it is on the page, you’ll often find the need to include lists in your Google Docs. There are two primary types of lists in documents: bulleted lists - lists where each item starts with a bullet numbered lists - lists where each item starts with a number To create either type of list, you can type the list out, with each item on a separate line. You’ll then highlight the text you want to be a list, and click on either the numbered list icon in the toolbar or the bulleted list icon in the toolbar to create the type of list you want to create. {format: png} 5.0.2.4 Inserting an Image We previously covered this briefly; however, we’ll cover how to insert an image into your Google Doc in more detail now. To insert an image, you’ll make sure the cursor is in your document where you would like to insert the image, and then you’ll click on the insert an image icon in the toolbar to display a drop-down menu with options: {format: png} There are a number of ways in which you can insert an image that will appear on this menu. Most frequently, you’ll likely be including images that are either on your computer or from a URL. We’ll discuss those in detail now, but feel free to play around with the other options to understand them as well. 5.0.2.4.1 From a URL If there’s an image on the Internet that you would like to insert into your Google Doc, Google makes this simple for you. For example if you were on Google and searched for “R language image”, you’d likely get results looking something similar to this: {format: png} If you were to click on ‘Images for R language’, you’d see lots of images from which to choose. If you were to scroll through these, you could select your favorite image, and right-click on it. {format: png} From the drop-down menu, click on “Copy Image Address.” This copies the image address (the URL) for this image. This enables you to paste it in your Google Doc. {format: png} You would then return to your Google Doc, ensure that your cursor is where you would like to insert the image and click on the image icon in the toolbar, and select “By URL” from the drop-down menu {format: png} In the box that pops up, you’ll then paste the URL that you just copied by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl + v. {format: png} The image you selected will automatically appear in that box. Now, you just have to click “INSERT.” {format: png} The image will now appear in your Google Doc! {format: png} Whenever you’re using an image that is not your own, whether in a Google Doc, a Google Sheet presentation, or anywhere else, it’s important to include the source information, to give credit to the people whose image it is and to allow others to find the image if they want to. {format: png} Note: If an image you select does not work with these instructions, there is a chance that you do not have permission to use that image. In that case, it’s likely best to search for an alternate image. 5.0.2.4.2 From your computer In addition to inserting images from URL, you may need to insert images that are on your computer locally. We previously discussed that there is not much local storage on your Chromebook; however, if you have saved an image to that space, you can insert it in your Google Doc using the following procedure. First, you’ll click on Insert Image Icon and click on the “Upload from computer” from the drop-down menu. On your Chromebook, this will give you access to your Downloads folder. {format: png} If the file you want to insert has been recently downloaded, it will appear first in the list that appears. Click on the image you want to insert and then click “OPEN” at the bottom right-hand of the screen. {format: png} Your image will now be inserted in your Google Doc! As mentioned in the previous section, don’t forget to include your source! {format: png} 5.0.2.5 Inserting a Table In addition to inserting lists and images, you may find the need to insert tables into your Google Docs. To do so, you’ll make sure your cursor is in your Google Doc where you’d like to insert the table and then click on “Insert” from the menu along the top of your Google Doc. From the drop-down menu, you’ll click on Table. {format: png} This will expose an additional menu from which you’ll select how many columns and rows you want the table to have. For example, if you want a table with 4 columns and two rows, you’ll highlight that in the squares that pop up and click once. {format: png} In this case, a 4x2 (meaning 4 columns and 2 rows) has been inserted in your document. {format: png} You can then click in the squares of the table to add text to your table. Note that all of the formatting discussed earlier in this lesson still applies within a table. You can change the font, font size, and color of text within a table. Finally, to change additional things within your table, you can always put your cursor in the table and right-click to expose a drop-down menu, and make a selection from that list. If you need additional columns or rows or to delete columns or rows, that can be accomplished in this manner. {format: png} 5.0.3 Renaming Your Document “Untitled document” is not a great name for your Google Doc. To change the name of your document, simply click in the “Untitled document” box at the top of the Google Doc and type in what you would like your filename to be. In this case, we chose “google_doc_intro.” We’ll cover how to best name files in a later course; however, for now, make sure you change the name of your Google Docs to something more informative than “Untitled document”, and very briefly, it’s best not to use spaces in your filenames but rather to use an underscore anywhere you would otherwise put a space. {format: png} 5.0.4 Download documents in different formats You can also download Google Docs documents in most common formats. You should click on “File” in the top menu and then select “Download as.” You can then choose the format you want among the options including .pdf, .docx, .rtf, etc. {format: png} For sharing documents you can follow the procedure we learned in the lesson on Google Drive. 5.0.5 More specifics on using Google Docs This lesson has covered a number of helpful features within Google Docs. There are many more capabilities within this application, so feel free to play around and check out additional resources here and on the web. For example, there are many tutorials for using Drive on YouTube.com. Google also has extensive information on getting started with Drive on their G Suite Learning Center, which can be found at the following web address: https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/docs/get-started/#!/ If you’re already familiar with Microsoft Word, Google Docs also operates very similarly without a couple of Word’s more advanced features. However, most tasks can be done with Google Docs, from simple text editing to importing images and graphs to exporting documents as PDFs. There are more in-depth guides on creating documents and downloading and printing. 5.0.6 Additional Resources Google’s Google Doc Tutorial GCF Learn Tutorial 5.0.7 Slides and Video Google Docs Slides {quiz, id: quiz_05_docs} 5.0.8 Google Docs quiz {choose-answers:4} ?1 Which one of the following is NOT true about Google Docs?

Google Sheets allows users to format and edit spreadsheets with other users simultaneously. As mentioned in an earlier course, this tool is very similar to Microsoft Excel in how you use it; however, Google Sheets makes working with others way easier than Microsoft Excel. As data scientists are often members of teams, this is a really helpful feature. The documents created with Google Sheets are compatible with Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx) and comma delimited values (.csv), two commonly-used spreadsheet file types, making Google Sheets a great option for working with data in spreadsheets. Like Google Docs, Google Sheets can be accessed from within Google Drive. To create a new spreadsheet through Drive, simply click the “New” button in the top left corner of the Google Drive home page and then select “Google Sheets.” {format: png} Alternatively, you can go directly to the Google Sheets URL at https://sheets.google.com. Remember, Google Drive contains all of the files you have stored on the cloud, while Google Sheets will only contain your spreadsheet files. Google Sheets has a TEMPLATE GALLERY just like Google Docs, where you can choose a blank spreadsheet or select any of the available templates. In our case, select the ‘Blank’ option under “Start a new spreadsheet” to get started. {format: png} 6.0.1 Entering Data Entering data was covered in an earlier lesson; however, briefly here, to enter text into a cell, you put your cursor in that cell and type what you want in the cell. This skill was used to generate the Leanpub data for your first data science project. We’ll be using this data as an example to demonstrate the features in Google Sheets with which you’ll want to be familiar. To follow along with this lesson on your own, you could open up that Google Sheet you previously created and try out all of the features discussed in this lesson on your own. {format: png} You’ll also note that within Google Sheets there are options similar to options in Google Docs allowing you to alter the font, size, and color of the data in your Google Sheet. We’re not going to discuss these options in detail for one particular reason. In data science, spreadsheets are used to store data. So, we tend to be most interested in the actual data in these sheets, and are not particularly interested in how pretty the data are. In fact, if you change the color of the text or increase its size in Google Sheets, when you later read that data into RStudio to analyze it, that information is lost. So, we try to avoid conveying information in spreadsheets with color highlighting or font changes. Thus, while it’s possible, this functionality will largely be ignored for our purposes. {format: png} 6.0.2 Formatting the Google Sheet Despite the fact that we’re going to ignore how to change the font text, size, and color, there are a number of helpful properties that you’ll want to be comfortable in in Google Sheets. 6.0.2.1 Changing the width of a column First, to change the width of a column, hover your mouse to the right of the column whose width you’d like to change. If you wanted to change the size of the first column (column A), you’d hover your mouse between the “A” and “B” column labels. A small black arrow will appear. You will then click and drag your mouse to the right to increase the column size. Once you have the desired size, release the mouse. You’ll have increased the width of the column! {format: png} 6.0.2.2 Auto-fit the width of a column If you would like the column width to be just large enough to see all the text in each row of your column, you can double-click on the separator to the right of the column you would like to auto-resize. {format: png} 6.0.2.3 Changing the width of multiple columns Finally, you aren’t limited to changing the width of one column at a time. If you highlight multiple columns and then drag the separator between the columns, it will resize all highlighted columns at once. highlighting multiple columns will resize all selected at once 6.0.2.4 Changing the height of a row In addition to altering the width of a column, you can also adjust the height of a row using the same process. Hover your mouse beneath the row you’d like to adjust and drag until you’ve reached your desired height. 6.0.3 Inserting, Deleting, and Moving Often times when you’re entering data you’ll realize that you need an extra column somewhere, want to delete a column entirely, or you’ll want to move a column from where it is to somewhere else in the Google Sheet. To insert a column, you’ll first highlight the existing column where you want to add a new a column, you’ll then click with two fingers on the column where you want to insert a new column, and a drop down menu will appear. From this menu, select “Insert 1 right” to insert a column to the right of the selected column. (Alternatively, “Insert 1 left” would insert a column to the left.) {format: png} Now you have a new column where you can enter additional information. {format: png} A similar process would be used to delete a column. You would highlight the column you wanted to delete, click with two fingers, and select “Delete column” from the drop-down menu. To move an entire column, you again begin by highlighting the column you would like to move. Then you hover over the column label until a little hand appears, and click and drag the column from where it is to where in the spreadsheet you would like it to be. The same tasks can be carried out on rows; however, you’ll start by highlighting the row, rather than the column. 6.0.4 Freezing rows and columns An additional helpful feature of Google Sheets is the ability to freeze rows and columns. Imagine you have a spreadsheet with many columns, so many that you can’t see them all on your computer screen at once. In the first column, maybe you have a person’s name. This means that you’d likely want to be able to scroll through your columns to see the ones at the end of your spreadsheet, but you’d still like to be able to see the person’s name in the first column. You can freeze the first column, which keeps its information displayed, even when you scroll across a spreadsheet. Both columns and rows can be frozen by clicking on ‘View’ at the top of Google Sheets and hovering over ‘Freeze’ to display your freeze options. {format: png} 6.0.5 Wrapping text Occasionally, a column of data will have a lot of information in it. You won’t want to make this column so wide that you can’t see any of the other columns in your spreadsheet. In such cases, text-wrapping can be very helpful. To wrap the text in a column, you would first highlight the column where you wanted to wrap the text and click on the text-wrapping icon. A menu with options will appear. To wrap text, select the icon in the middle. {format: png} This will wrap the text in the selected column so that your rows are now taller and you can see all of the text in the cells at once. {format: png} 6.0.6 Creating Multiple Sheets Another feature of Google Sheets is that you can have multiple worksheets in a single Google Sheets document. While the data we’ve been using so far has only included data from a single sheet, to add a second sheet to this Google, you would simply click on the plus sign at the bottom-left hand of the Google Sheet window. {format: png} This will open up a second worksheet within the same document. Notice that your original data are still there in the tab labeled “Sheet1”. To return to that sheet, just click on the “Sheet1” tab. {format: png} While the sheets are named “Sheet1” and “Sheet2” by default, it is possible to rename these sheets. To do so, click with two fingers on the sheet you would like to rename and click on “Rename…” This will enable you to type a new sheet name into the tab. Click enter once you’ve entered your new sheet name {format: png} 6.0.7 A note on merging cells If you’re familiar with Excel, you may have merged cells together in the past. Maybe you had a title and wanted to combine a few columns together from a single row into a cell. This is still possible within Google Sheets; however, we’re going to discourage you from merging cells. In a future course, we’ll discuss tidy data. Tidy data are the kind of data that are easy to work with during data analysis. Merging cells limits your ability to have tidy data. Thus, we are going to just caution you not to merge cells. {format: png} 6.0.8 Accessing, downloading, and sharing your spreadsheets All of the Google Sheets you generate are saved automatically on your Google Sheets account as well as to your Google Drive account. Just like Google Docs, Google Sheets has an auto-save feature that means you don’t need to actively save your work. You can also download your spreadsheet from Google Sheets in most common spreadsheet formats. You should click on “File” in the top menu and then select “Download as.” You can then choose the format you want among the options including .csv (a comma separated file) and .xlsx (an Excel file). {format: png} For sharing documents you can follow the procedure we learned in the lesson on Google Drive. You can also share directly from the spreadsheet itself by clicking “File” in the top menu and then choosing “Share” and entering email addresses of the people you want to share with or getting a shareable link. {format: png} 6.0.9 More specifics on using Google Sheets This lesson and the introductory course have covered a number of helpful features within Google Sheets. There is always more to learn, however, so check out the additional resources here and on the web. For example, there are many tutorials for using Sheets on YouTube.com. Google also has extensive information on getting started with Drive on their G Suite Learning Center, which can be found at the following web address: https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/sheets/get-started/#!/ 6.0.10 Additional resources: modifying columns and rows formatting cells working with multiple sheets 6.0.11 Slides and Video Google Sheets Slides {quiz, id: quiz_06_sheets} 6.0.12 Google Sheets quiz {choose-answers:4} ?

Text-wrapping remains on and column is not auto-adjusted. Text will still wrap within the cell; Auto-adjustment will not occur. Text-wrapping is automatically turned off and auto-adjustment happens as if text wrapping weren’t on. Text-wrapping remains on but auto-adjustment happens as if text wrapping weren’t on. The column’s contents will be deleted. The font size of the text-wrapped column will decrease. {/quiz} "],["google-slides.html", "Chapter 7 Google Slides", " Chapter 7 Google Slides In addition to Google Docs for word documents and Google Sheets for spreadsheets, Google also has a web-based slide presentation editor called Google Slides. Google Slides allows users to format and edit slide presentations online and with Slide’s sharing capabilities, multiple people can edit the slides at the same time. As a data scientist, Google Slides can be a powerful tool to present your work to your employer or contribute to a presentation with your colleagues. If you’ve ever used Microsoft Powerpoint, you can think of Slides as an online version of Powerpoint, but with the additional capability to work simultaneously with other users on the same set of slides! It is compatible with Microsoft Powerpoint files (.pptx and .ppt). 7.0.1 Presentation Guidelines Before we talk details about how to work within Google Slides, we want to review a few best practices for slide presentation. To make a good slide show, it’s best to keep a few guidelines in mind: Minimize the number of words you put on any slide. Whenever possible, use pictures instead of words. Make sure images and text are as large as possible. Use consistent text font and colors throughout the presentation. 7.0.2 Accessing Google Slides Like Docs and Sheets, Google Slides can be accessed from within Google Drive. To create a new presentation through Drive, simply click the “New” button in the top left corner of the Google Drive home page and then select “Google Slides.” {format: png} Like Docs and Sheets, however, you can also access Google Slides directly through its own URL, https://slides.google.com. Remember, Google Drive contains all of the files you have stored on the cloud, while Google Slides will only contain your presentation files. Your Google Slides homepage will have the same structure as for Docs and Sheets. You can see there is a TEMPLATE GALLERY at the top of the screen and recent presentations at the bottom. To start a new presentation, you can select the “Blank” option or any of the available templates. {format: png} Clicking on “TEMPLATE GALLERY” will expand the template options to include “Personal,” “Work,” and “Education” templates. {format: png} Once you click on “Blank” to create a blank presentation, you can begin to type in the dotted boxes to add text to your presentation. {format: png} 7.0.3 Creating a Full Slideshow So far, this lesson has covered how to open a new slide show in Google Slides and how to enter text onto your first slide. However, to create a full slideshow, you’ll want to know how to: Add new slides Use different slide layouts Format text Add and edit images Change the theme and format of your slide show Rearrange slide order The remainder of this lesson will be dedicated to covering these topics. 7.0.3.1 Adding new slides To add a new slide to your slideshow, you’ll click the plus sign at the left on the toolbar at the top of your Google Slides presentation. {format: png} A second slide will appear in the panel at the left. The blue highlighting around around the second slide in the panel at the left indicates that that slide is the slide being displayed on the right. {format: png} You may notice that this slide has a different layout than the first slide. The first slide had a large text box for the title. This slide, however, has a a text box for a title along the top and a large text box covering the rest of the slide. Google Slides is taking its best guess as to what type of slide you may want; however, you can always state which slide layout you want explicitly. 7.0.3.2 Changing layouts If the slide layout being displayed is not the slide layout you want, this can be easily changed by clicking on the “Layout” icon from the toolbar. {format: png} There are a number of different layouts from which you can choose, depending upon your needs. For example, you might only need a caption for a large image, so you could select the “Caption” layout choice. Click on the layout you’d like to use and the slide will change to the layout you’ve selected. You can always change the layout again if the one you’ve chosen doesn’t work well. As you gain experience making presentations, you will know which layouts work well for you! {format: png} 7.0.3.3 Formatting text As you start to add text to slides, you’ll quickly realize that the icons along the top and steps required are the same as they were in Google Docs. This is by design. Google has designed its suite of products so that once you master a skill in one of its products, you can use it in its other products. That said, you already know how to format text from the Google Docs lesson, so we won’t go over that here. {format: png} While the process for formatting text is the same, the one thing that differs between Google Docs and Google Slides is the fact that the positioning of the text box in Google Slides is important (and something you didn’t have to consider in Google Docs). To re-position a text box in Google slides, you’ll first click on the text box. Then, by hovering over the blue highlighted border around the text box, you will see a cross made of arrows appear. Once this arrow cross appears, you click and hold down. While still holding down, you can drag the text box to the the position on the slide where you want the box. Once the text is where you want it, you can release. The text box will now be wherever you’ve dropped the text box on the slide. 7.0.3.4 Adding and editing images To add images to a slideshow, the process is again the same as in Google Docs, and the process for re-positioning an image on the slide is the same as was just discussed. However, in Google Slides, you’ll likely be editing the size and appearance of images to a greater extent than you would need to in Google Docs. We’ll discuss how to work with images in Google Slides here. 7.0.3.4.1 Cropping an image Consider the following image in Google Slides. Notice that the blue box around the outside of the image is much larger than the actual image we’re interested in using. To crop out this extra white space, you’ll want to first click on the icons, you’ll select the crop icon. {format: png} The outline around the image will now have black bars around it. {format: png} These black bars can be dragged to the position where you’d like the image to be. {format: png} After the image is the size you want it to be, hit ‘Enter’ or click away from the image on your screen. The image has now been cropped, as indicated by the now-smaller blue outline on the image! {format: png} 7.0.3.4.2 Aligning objects In addition to adding images, often you’ll want to be sure that images on your slides are aligned so that they look good when you go to present the information. Google Slides makes that pretty easy to do. To align images, you’ll drag your cursor over the objects to select all the objects you want to align. Once selected, you’ll right click on the selected objects to display a menu. You’ll then use the “Align horizontally” and “Align vertically” options to align the objects the way you want them. {format: png} 7.0.3.5 Additional formatting options Additional formatting options can be explored by right-clicking on the image that will show a menu with additional options or by clicking on the additional image-editing icons on the toolbar. {format: png} 7.0.3.6 Formatting and editing themes In addition to formatting individual text boxes and images on your slides, you may want to format the design of your entire slide show. This can be accomplished, by clicking on the “Theme” icon along the toolbar {format: png} Note: If you do not see the “Theme” icon, click on a blank spot on your slide. This will make the toolbar option appear. After clicking on the “Theme” icon, a panel will appear on the right side of your screen with all the pre-loaded themes available. {format: png} You can scroll through these themes. Clicking on one of these themes will apply the theme across every slide in your presentation. {format: png} 7.0.3.6.1 Changing background color In addition to pre-specified themes, you can also alter the background color of all your slides. To do so, you would right-click on a blank spot on your slide. On the menu that appears, you would select “Change background” {format: png} A menu will appear where you can select the color you want your slides to be from the drop-down menu and click “Done.” This will only change the background color of the slide on which you’re currently working. {format: png} 7.0.3.7 Rearranging slides Sometimes as you’re generating a slide show, you’ll realize you’d rather your slides be in a different order. This can be fixed easily by clicking on a slide in the left hand panel of your Google Slides window, and dragging and dropping your slide to the position in your slide show where you’d rather it be. {format: png} 7.0.4 Presenting Your Slideshow Once you have created all the slides you want in your slideshow, you can easily present them. On the right-hand corner of the window, click on Present and your slides will be in full-screen mode ready to be presented. {format: png} 7.0.5 Accessing, downloading, and sharing your slides All of the Google Slides you generate are saved automatically on your Google Slides account as well as to your Google Drive account. Like the other document editors you’ve learned about, Google Slides has an auto-save feature that means you don’t need to actively save your work. You can also download your presentations from Google Slides in different formats, such as Microsoft Powerpoint or Adobe PDF files. To do this, you would click on “File” in the top menu and then select “Download as.” You can then choose the format you want among the various options. {format: png} For sharing documents you can follow the procedure we learned in the lesson on Google Drive. You can also share directly from the Slides itself by clicking “File” in the top menu and then choosing “Share” and entering email addresses of the people you want to share with or getting a shareable link. {format: png} 7.0.6 More specifics on using Google Slides Here, we have covered the basics of Google Slides.

Google Hangouts is also famous for its video conferencing feature; you can video chat with up to 25 people at the same time and message a team of up to 150 people. These features make Google Hangouts an excellent tool for staying connected with collaborators, employers, and friends. An additional bonus feature of Hangouts is that it syncs automatically across different devices. That is, you can start a Hangout on your phone and continue your chat on another device such as your laptop. 8.0.1 Accessing your Google Hangouts account Like the other Google services we’ve talked about, you need a Google account in order to use Hangouts. To access your Hangouts account, You can either go to the Hangouts URL at https://hangouts.google.com or click on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for “Hangouts”. If you’re not already logged in to your Google account, first you’ll need to log in. Here’s a screenshot of Jane’s Google Hangouts screen: {format: png} On this screen you can see that there are options for making a video call, a phone call, or sending a text message. 8.0.2 Video chats You can initiate a video call by clicking on the “Video Call” button located at the center of the screen. {format: png} When this button is clicked, a new window will open for the video call. Google Hangouts may request permission to use your computer’s camera and microphone for the call. If you see this request, you should click “Allow” to continue your call. {format: png} Once you’ve given permission, you’ll be taken to your call. You can invite people to your video call in two ways. One option is to enter their names or email addresses directly into the invitation box and click “Invite.” Another way is to click the “Copy Link To Share” button and paste this link into an your own email invitation. This second option is an easy way to invite a large number of people to a video call. {format: png} Notice that if you have already exchanged emails with someone, meaning they are in your Gmail address book, they will automatically show up when you begin to type in the invitation box. In this case, we see John Doe’s contact information when we just type “John” into the box. {format: png} During the video call, the default is for your microphone and video camera to be on so that the other people on the call can both see and hear you. You can choose to mute your audio and/or video feeds by clicking on the microphone and/or camera buttons at the bottom of the screen. Sometimes it can be useful to mute your audio if you are listening to other people talking and don’t want noises from your environment to distract you from the call. You can un-mute by simply clicking the appropriate button again. You can also click the three dots at the very right corner of the screen to see options for the call: share screen, fullscreen, chat, help, and feedback. {format: png} If you want to share your screen with people currently in your call simply click on the “Share Screen” option and choose either to share your entire screen or just one specific application window that you have open. If you share your entire screen, the other people on your call will be able to see everything on your screen, even when you click between applications. If you only share a single application window, they won’t be able to see things on your screen that aren’t in that application window. Sharing a single application can be useful if you want to be able to check your email during the call without letting everyone else see your messages! {format: png} Once you’ve shared your screen, you can stop sharing at any time by pressing on the “STOP” button located at the top of the screen. If you want to make the video call into fullscreen you can select the “Fullscreen” on the option menu. {format: png} If you need to send a text message to everyone in the video call, you can choose “Chat” from option menu. A message window will then open in the lower as the one shown below on the lower left corner of your call screen. Simply type your message and press the arrow to send! {format: png} If you need more information or have any questions about using Google Hangouts, choose “Help” from the option menu. This will open a new window with tutorials and guides on how to solve problems and explanations on how to use Google Hangouts. {format: png} 8.0.3 Phone calls You can also make a phone call in Google Hangouts. This allows you to contact someone through a phone number instead of via email address. You make a call by clicking on the “Phone Call” button on the main Hangouts screen {format: png} To enter a phone number you can press on the “New Conversation” button on the left menu. After entering the number you can select what country you want to call and simply press “Call”. The first time you make a phone call from Hangouts, you may be asked to register a phone number where they can contact you if there are any problems with the call. Follow the instructions onscreen to do this. {format: png} 8.0.4 Messaging You can also message other people with Google accounts through Hangouts. To start a message, click on the “Message” button. {format: png} Then you can enter the name, email address, or phone number of the person you want to message. When you find the correct person you can simply click on them and that will open a conversation box. Type your message in the box and hit enter to send the message! {format: png} 8.0.5 Group conversations In Hangouts, you can have a video/audio/text conversation with multiple people at the same time. You can have a conversation with up to 150 people and a video call with up to 25 people at the same time. Everyone who wants to join a group conversation must use Hangouts. For a group video call, just enter in multiple names and/or email addresses when starting your call. In text messaging, click on the “New group” link and then enter in the names and or email addresses and or phone numbers for all of the people in the group. {format: png} 8.0.6 More specifics on using Google Hangouts Google Hangouts is an excellent way to communicate with outhers about your work, all through a web browser or your Chromebook! We’ve covered some of the main features of Hangouts here. If you want to know more, you can search for tutorials on YouTube.com or check out Google’s guide to getting started with Hangouts at the following web address: https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/hangouts/get-started/#!/ 8.0.7 Slides and Video Google Hangouts Slides {quiz, id: quiz_08_hangouts} 8.0.8 Google Hangouts quiz {choose-answers:4} ?

The videos hosted on YouTube range from home videos to music videos, movie trailers, and TV shows. Access to the content on Youtube is free but comes with commercials (you have to only pay to watch videos free of commercials). In order to upload videos, you need to have a Google account, but watching the content does not require any login. However, you need to login if you want to rate or comment on a video. For a data scientist, YouTube can be an excellent resource for video tutorials on tools and tips of the trade. You can easily find step-by-step tutorials and other resources on any of the tools we’ve already discussed in this course by simply searching YouTube. 9.0.1 Accessing YouTube You can access YouTube by going to the URL youtube.com in your web browser. You can also click on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for “YouTube”. If you aren’t logged into your Google account, you will arrive at a generic YouTube home page, where you can watch videos and search for specific video content. You can search for content using the search box at the top of the screen. If you want to get more personalized results or create your own playlists, you should log in via your Google account. You can do this by clicking on on the “SIGN IN” link in the top right corner of the screen. {format: png} On your personal YouTube home page, you will see YouTube’s recommendations for videos that you might like to watch. YouTube is also good with learning about your preferences. If you watch a video that is about how to import data into R, YouTube will suggest more videos related to those keywords to you. You can also easily locate videos you’ve already watched by clicking on “History” in the left-side menu. {format: png} 9.0.2 Finding videos There are various ways you can find relevant videos on YouTube: By viewing the charts ranking the Most Popular videos in any given category by clicking on the Trending icon on the left menu. By browsing channels via the link https://www.youtube.com/channels. You can browse channels from news and politics to technology. By searching videos by typing keywords in the search bar. For instance if you type “What is data science?”, YouTube will find around 22 million videos. {format: png} Note that you can filter your results when you search for specific keywords by clicking on the Filter icon on the top right corner. For instance, you can filter based on the length of the video or the time it was posted. {format: png} 9.0.3 Data science on YouTube For our purposes, here is a list of some of the most popular YouTube channels on data science. You can find any of these channels by searching for the name, for example “Data Science Dojo,” in the YouTube Search box. You can then subscribe to the channel by clicking the red “Subscribe” box on the right. {format: png} You can find the channels that you have subscribed to under the “Subscriptions” section in the left-hand menu of your YouTube home page. {format: png} 9.0.4 How to save videos to watch later Sometimes you may discover an interesting video on YouTube, but may be too busy to watch it right away. One way to save the video so you can watch it later is to “like” the video by clicking the “thumbs up” icon below the video screen. {format: png} This will add the video to your favorites, which can be found under “Liked videos” in the left-hand menu on your YouTube home page. {format: png} Overall, YouTube is be a great place to go to for finding answers to your questions. There are millions of videos explaining things that you might not know about or pertaining to topics that you don’t want to read pages and pages of text in order to understand.

Think of it like a group chat, but for work-related subjects. A lot of companies and workplaces look down on using Facebook and Twitter for communication, seeing them more as just social media platforms, rather than effective platforms for communication at work. Some places even ban the use of these platforms. However, Basecamp is being used by more and more companies as a communication tool. We covered how to get a Basecamp login in the introductory course, but we didn’t discuss the details of how to use Basecamp. So, in this lesson, we’ll pick up from where you last left off (with a Basecamp login in hand) and discuss why Basecamp has become the platform for communication within companies and how to get started using Basecamp. 10.0.1 How to Access Basecamp? To get started, go to Basecamp online at slack.com/signin. We’ll note here that Basecamp also has a mobile app, so if you’d like to check those out, feel free. But, in this lesson, we’ll work from the Chrome browser, without an app. 10.0.2 Basecamp is organized into teams and projects If you’re new to Basecamp, you will not yet be a member of any teams, and that’s ok! If you ask people who have been using Basecamp for a while, they’ll envy you. You’ll see over time that you’ll likely become a member of many different Basecamp teams! For now though, we’ll walk through how to start your own team to get you acquainted with the features of Slack. 10.0.3 Creating a team If you go to slack.com and click on “GET STARTED” {format: png} You’ll be brought to a screen where to create your own team, you’ll want to click on “Create a new workspace.” {format: png} You’ll then be asked for your email, which you should enter and then click “Confirm.” {format: png} At this point, you may see a screen asking for a 6-digit code. Go to the e-mail address you entered and look for this six-digit code in an email from Basecamp. Enter this code in this window. {format: png} After entering the six-digit code correctly, you’ll automatically be brought to a screen where you will be asked for your full name and your display name. Your display name will be the name that others see when you message within Basecamp. It’s okay if this is your full name or a shortened version of your full name – as long as the people in the team will know who you are when they see it, then that will work for your display name. Once that information has been entered, click “Continue to Password.” {format: png} You will also have to enter your password. After choosing a strong password and entering it, you’ll click “Continue to Workspace Info” {format: png} At this point, you’re ready to start creating your team! You’ll be asked what your team will be used for. For this example we’ll select “School” from the drop-down menu and fill in the rest of the information Slack asks for about our team. Once the information has all been filled out, click on “Continue to Group Name.” {format: png} You’ll be asked what your group should be called. For this example, we’ll call the group “Schoolwork.” This is what will be displayed to all members of the team who use this workspace. You will enter this name and then click “Continue to Workspace URL.” {format: png} Now, you’ll enter your Workspace URL. This is what URL you will use to sign into this Slack workspace yourself or (eventually) to send to others to join your workspace. Here, we’ve chosen the URL to be “schoolwork-doe.slack.com.” These URLs will always end in “slack.com”. After entering your desired URL, you’ll click “Create Workspace.” {format: png} You’ll be prompted to review the terms. After reviewing the terms of service, click “I Agree” if you agree to follow Basecamp’s terms. {format: png} At this point, you’ll be prompted to send invitations to others who may want to join this workspace. For this example, we won’t be inviting anyone else for now, so we’ll click “Skip For Now.” {format: png} You’re almost there! You’ll now be asked if you want to download the App or continue in the browser. For now, we’ll click “continue in the browser.” {format: png} Welcome to your very own workspace! We’ll now walk through Basecamp to get you acquainted with messaging in Slack. At the bottom right-hand of the window, there will be a screen welcoming you to Slack. {format: png} If you click on “Let’s go,” you’ll be brought to a screen that you can scroll through using the white arrows at the left and right. Scrolling through these will display different windows that explain the main functions of Slack: channels, messages, and uploading documents. We’ll walk through those basics now, but feel free to come back to these later and look through Basecamp’s instructions as well by clicking on “Try it now”! {format: png} To close out this box, click on the small x at the top right of the box. To display this box next time you log on, click “Remind me next time”. Otherwise click, “Skip completely”. {format: png} 10.0.4 Channels You’ll now be brought to your workspace! Note the name of your workspace “Schoolwork” is up at the top left-hand side of your screen. You’ll also note under “Channels” there are already two channels listed. Discussion within Slack is channel-based. That means that members of a channel will be able to see and search all discussions within a channel. Generally, different channels exist for different projects. This way only the people on the project will have access and be alerted of messages in that channel. And, others who are not involved will not have to be bothered by messages that are not important to them! Each channel is listed with a pound sign to the left of the channel name. Here you have a channel called “general” and another called “random”. These two channels will be available in every workspace you create. If you click on the “general” channel, you’ll see along the top that Slack explains that this channel is for “Company-wide announcements and work-based matters.” {format: png} To display further information about this channel, click on the ‘i’ icon along the top. This will open up channel information including how many members there are in this channel. {format: png} 10.0.4.1 Creating a channel While #general and #random are helpful channels, you often want to create additional channels for new projects. To do so, you would click the plus-sign icon to the right of “Channels.” {format: png} A new screen will pop up so that you can begin to create a channel. There are two general types of channels. Public channels are viewable by anyone who is in the workspace. {format: png} If you click on the green “Public” button, it will toggle a change to display an orange “private” button. Private channels can only be viewed by those who are invited to join. For this example, we’ll create a private channel {format: png} To continue creating a private channel, you’ll want to fill out the Name of the channel (what will be displayed underneath “Channels”) and the channel’s purpose (a longer explanation that will be displayed along the top once you click on the channel). Once this information has been filled out, you’ll click “Create Channel.” {format: png} With that, your new channel “assignments” is available underneath Channels! Note that because it is a private channel, there is a lock icon to the left of the channel name. Public channels will have a pound sign. Private channels will display this lock symbol. {format: png} 10.0.4.2 Messaging occurs within a channel On Slack, messaging occurs within a channel. This way conversations are organized based on a particular topic and seen only by those for whom the message is important! So, with a newly created channel, you can now begin messaging within it. To do so, you’ll click on the “assignments” channel and then begin to type your message in the bar at the bottom. 10.0.4.3 Sending a message {format: png} A great feature of Slack is that every member of a channel can see the messages within that channel. However, sometimes, you want to ensure that someone in particular sees the message. To do so, you include their name by first typing @ within your message. This will display a list of names that you can include. You can either choose a name by clicking on it in this list, or by beginning to type the person’s name until it is listed and highlighted in the above menu and hitting “enter.” {format: png} Once the name has been selected it will display in your message. {format: png} After you hit enter, your message will send and the person you’ve specified in the message will receive a specific notification highlighting that a message has been directed specifically to them. {format: png} 10.0.4.4 Messages are searchable While in this example you’re at the beginning of your message history within Slack, as time goes on there will be more and more channels and workspaces and long message histories. If, sometime in the future, you want to return to this message, you can do so by using the search bar at the top. {format: png} Slack allows you to search by term for Messages, Files, or both (All). Just start typing your search term into the search bar, and Slack will begin to provide results matching your search. Slack’s search capabilities are powerful. This feature will likely save you a lot of time in the future when you have to refer back to messages from the past. 10.0.4.5 Uploading a document In addition to sending messages within a channel and being able to direct the messages at certain people, you also often want to be able to share images or documents with others. To upload a document to be included with your message, you’ll click on the plus sign to the left of the message bar. {format: png} A drop-down menu will display. To upload a file from your computer, click on “Your computer”. Then, search your computer for the file you want to include. Here, I’ve selected an image on my computer. A box will show up asking if you want to upload this file you’ve selected. A preview of the image (in this case) will display. You’ll be able to change the title of the file, decide in which channel it should be shared, and include a comment with the file. Once all of the necessary information is included, you’ll click “Upload.” {format: png} Your message will now be sent and visible to everyone else in the specified channel. {format: png} 10.0.4.6 Reacting to a message So far we’ve discussed how to send messages to other, but Slack is particularly great because of its capabilities to foster discussion amongst members in a workspace. Thus, often you’ll be reacting and responding to others’ messages. To do so you’ll hover over the message to which you want to react. You can either react with an emoji, start a thread to respond with text, or share the message with someone else in your workspace. {format: png} 10.0.4.7 Editing and deleting a message Additionally, the three dots icon at the end of the display options can be clicked on to display additional options. Within this menu, you will find options to edit and delete messages you’ve sent. {format: png} 10.0.4.8 Direct messaging So far, we’ve discussed communicating within a channel, allowing for team-based communications. This is where Slack really shines! However, Slack does have the ability to direct message individuals within your workspace. This means you can send a message to a person or multiple people outside of the specified channels. To direct message someone, you’ll click on the plus sign to the right of “Direct Messages”. {format: png} This will display a box where you’ll search for someone’s name. Once you’ve found the person you want to message directly, you’ll click on their name and click “Go.” {format: png} You’ll continue to message this person as discussed for messages within a group by typing in the message bar and hitting “enter to send the message” 10.0.5 Joining a team While we’ve been working within a team we just created, another great thing about Slack is that you can be a member of multiple different teams. There are a few different ways to join already-established teams. To do so, you’d return to slack.com/signin and click on “GET STARTED”. This time around you would clock on “Find your Slack workspace.” {format: png} 10.0.5.1 Joining an established team by e-mail search To find your Slack workspace associated with a company or workplace, you would then enter your work-specific e-mail address (not a general gmail address). This would give you a list of workspaces to which you had access given the email address you input. You could search among the available workspaces for the workspace(s) you’re interested in joining. {format: png} 10.0.5.2 Joining an established team by invite Alternatively, to join an established team, this can be accomplished by invite. You’ll need an invitation similar to what you see here, which would be sent to you from the workspace by e-mail: {format: png} Once you have the invite, you would accept the invitation by clicking the green Join button. Similar to what was described above, Slack may ask for some information before moving on. If prompted, you’ll enter your first and last name, along with your email in the required fields before clicking “Next”. {format: png} Then, enter your password. A quick reminder that it’s best to choose a strong password that is different from your other passwords for security reasons. 10.0.6 Slack can work with other tools While we won’t discuss in detail here, it’s important to know that Slack works well with other applications. To see a list of the apps that you can integrate into Slack, click on the plus sign to the right of “Apps” {format: png} A list of available apps will be displayed. You can search by app name, or click “Install” for apps you want to integrate with Slack. For example, Google Drive is an example of an app that can be integrated. Installing this app would make sending docs, slides, and sheets from Google Drive within Slack simpler. {format: png} We won’t specify any to integrate at this point, but you’ll want to know that this functionality exists. 10.0.7 Cost of Slack Last but not least, Slack has different plans for different uses. Companies often pay for users’ within their company to have either the standard or plus levels. Details again aren’t important, but it’s important to know certain features are only available with a paid version of Slack. {format: png} 10.0.8 Slides and Video Slack Slides {quiz, id: quiz_10_slack} 10.0.9 Slack quiz {choose-answers: 4} ?
