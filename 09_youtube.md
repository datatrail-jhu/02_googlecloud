# YouTube

YouTube, as you might already know, is a video-sharing website that allows users to upload and view all sorts of videos.  The videos hosted on YouTube range from home videos to music videos, movie trailers, and TV shows. Access to the content on Youtube is free but comes with commercials (you have to only pay to watch videos free of commercials). In order to upload videos, you need to have a Google account, but watching the content does not require any login. However, you need to login if you want to rate or comment on a video.

For a data scientist, YouTube can be an excellent resource for video tutorials on tools and tips of the trade.  You can easily find step-by-step tutorials and other resources on any of the tools we've already discussed in this course by simply searching YouTube.

### Accessing YouTube

You can access YouTube by going to the URL [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) in your web browser.  You can also click on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for "YouTube".  

If you aren't logged into your Google account, you will arrive at a generic YouTube home page, where you can watch videos and search for specific video content.  You can search for content using the search box at the top of the screen.  If you want to get more personalized results or create your own playlists, you should log in via your Google account.  You can do this by clicking on on the "SIGN IN" link in the top right corner of the screen.

On your personal YouTube home page, you will see YouTube's recommendations for videos that you might like to watch.  YouTube is also good with learning about your preferences. If you watch a video that is about how to import data into R, YouTube will suggest more videos related to those keywords to you.  You can also easily locate videos you've already watched by clicking on "History" in the left-side menu.

### How to save videos to watch later

Sometimes you may discover an interesting video on YouTube, but may be too busy to watch it right away.  One way to save the video so you can watch it later is to "like" the video by clicking the "thumbs up" icon below the video screen.

There are millions of videos explaining things that you might not know about or pertaining to topics that you don't want to read pages and pages of text in order to understand.
