# Google Chrome

Google Chrome is Google's internet browser. An internet browser or web browser is a software that can be downloaded on your Windows or Mac computer (and is the default browser on your Chromebook) that you can use to access the web and surf websites. If you want to check NBA score, shop online, or Google the definition of a word, you will need to use an internet browser. In fact, without internet browsers we can't fully exploit the internet. When you enter the URL of a webpage such as [www.nba.com](www.nba.com), your browser locates and requests information about that webpage from a web server. Your browser then receives a code file (most likely in HTML or Javascript) that tells your browser what information and how that information from the webpage should be displayed. Your browser then reads and executes the code and displays the webpage for you. This all happens in just a few seconds (or even less).

While other web browsers such as Safari, Microsoft Edge (formerly Internet Explorer), or Firefox can be used instead of Chrome, Chrome is the most popular internet browser. This is what Chrome looks like when opened.

### Why Google Chrome

Google Chrome offers features that are unique in addition to features that most modern browsers offer. Below we investigate some of these features:

1. Signing in to Chrome using your Gmail account automatically sings you in to all Google services including YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, etc...

2. You can customize your experience by changing the settings and by adding apps, extensions, and themes. Extensions are small software programs that can be installed on Chrome. Extensions can block ads from being displayed, manage your passwords, translate, or create notes and todo lists.

3. Bookmark webpages you visit regularly. This feature is not unique to Chrome but often comes in handy. It's especially helpful if you don't want to type the full address of the webpages or are afraid you will forge them. To bookmark a webpage in Chrome, simply click on the star in the address bar or press Ctrl+D on your keyboard. This will open the following window.

If you click on Done, the bookmark will be saved to the Bookmarks bar. Next time you like to check the webpage you bookmarked without typing the address, you can click on the Chrome menu in the top-right corner, hover over Bookmarks, then click the bookmark you'd like to open.

4. Incognito mode creates a private browsing session that allows you to browse the web without leaving any fingerprint. When you're in Incognito Mode, your browser doesn't log what you've been doing during your last Internet session. To launch a new incognito window, press Ctrl+Shift+N, which opens a grey-colored window.

5. Tabbed browsing is another feature that most browsers have. It allows you to browse the web and view multiple pages in one browser window instead of opening multiple windows. To open a new tab, simply press Ctrl+T.

6. In-browser translation uses Google's signature translation service, Google Translate. If you are browsing a webpage in a language that you don't know, Google, in most cases, suggests to translate the webpage for you to English. Google translate is not perfect but the outcome is definitely better than staring at the webpage trying to make sense of the language you don't know.

For instance if you visit a website that is primariliy in a language other than your browser language, you will see a notification on top of the Chrome window that suggests tranalation for the website content. If you go to BBC in Japanses at http://www.bbc.com/japanese, Chrome will suggest to translate the whole page for you to English.
