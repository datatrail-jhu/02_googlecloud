# What is Gmail?

A box will pop-up where you can enter the recipient, subject, and content of the email. There are a few buttons at the buttom of the email box that are very helpful. 

First, you can attach a file (such as an image, a document, or a video) to your email by clicking on the attachment sign and choosing the file from your computer.

You can also choose files from your Google Drive folder. Google Drive is Google's file hosting service and we will learn about that soon. But for now, you can eastily attach a file that is hosted on your Google Drive to any email.
