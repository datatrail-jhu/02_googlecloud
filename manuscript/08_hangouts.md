# Google Hangouts

Google Hangouts is a communication platform by Google and includes tools such as messaging and video chat.  Google Hangouts is also famous for its video conferencing feature; you can video chat with up to 10 people at the same time and message a team of up to 150 people. These features make Google Hangouts an excellent tool for staying connected with collaborators, employers, and friends.

An additional bonus feature of Hangouts is that it syncs automatically across different devices.  That is, you can start a Hangout on your phone and continue your chat on another device such as your laptop. 

### Accessing your Google Hangout account

Like the other Google services we've talked about, you need a Google account in order to use Hangouts. To access your Hangouts account, You can either go to the Hangouts URL at [https://hangouts.google.com](https://hangouts.google.com) or click on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner of your Chromebook and searching for "Hangouts".  If you're not already logged in to your Google account, first you'll need to log in. Here's a screenshot of Jane's Google Hangouts screen:

On this screen you can see that there are options for making a video call, a phone call, or sending a text message.

### Starting a video chat

You can initiate a video call by clicking on the "Video Call" button located at the center of the screen.

When this button is clicked, a new window will open for the video call.  Google Hangouts may request permission to use your computer's camera and microphone for the call.  If you see this request, you should click "Allow" to continue your call.

Once you've given permission, you'll be taken to your call.  You can invite people to your video call in two ways.  One option is to enter their names or email addresses directly into the invitation box and click "Invite."  Another way is to click the "Copy Link To Share" button and paste this link into an your own email invitation.  This second option is an easy way to invite a large number of people to a video call.

Notice that if you have already exchanged emails with someone, meaning they are in your Gmail address book, they will automatically show up when you begin to type in the invitation box.  In this case, we see John.Everyday.Doe's contact information when we just type "John" into the box.

During the video call if you press on the button at the very right corner 5 settings will show up:
1. Share screen
2. Fullscreen
3. Chat
4. Help
5. Feedback

If you want to share your screen with people currently in your hangout simply click on the "Share Screen" option and choose either to share your entire screen or just one specific application window that you have open.

You can stop sharing your screen by pressing on the "STOP" button located at the top of the screen. If you want to make the video call into fullscreen you can press the "Fullscreen" button on the same menu. Sometimes you need to type a message to everyone in the video call. You can do this by pressing the "Chat" button that will show a pop-up as the one shown below on the lower left corner.
