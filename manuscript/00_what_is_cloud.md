# What is the cloud?

It's hard to find data scientists who don't work with the _cloud_ and cloud computing is the talk of the town these days. But what is the cloud?

Cloud storage refers to data/document storage on the web rather than your local computer. If you share documents via Dropbox, have your documents stores on Google Drive, or store all your pictures on iCloud or Google Photos, you are using the _cloud_. Cloud is like having an external hard drive that you don't really see. Cloud compuring 


## Cloud computing
Cloud computing is data analysis using applications and software that are running on shared data centers rather than running on your local computers. Cloud computing has changed the way we think about data analytics especially when it comes to working with big data. We no longer need to spend thousands of dollars to own high-capacity computers to do big data analytics. Your local computer no longer have to do all the heavy lifting and instead the network of computers (from Amazon, IBM, Microsoft among many others) will do the job instead. Your computer will only need to run the interface software which in most cases is your browser. In future lessons we will study cloud-based data analytics in details.


# Why should I use the cloud?

Well, the manin advantage of the cloud is that you can access your files everywhere even if you don't have your personal computer with you. 

The second most important advantage of cloud storage is that in case of a disaster (accidental deletion of files, stolen computer, fire, or meteor attack) your files are safe on the cloud. Moreover, most services provide backup services in case of accidental deletion of your files from the cloud. 

The third advantage that comes with cloud computing is more power as we initially discussed. Remote machines that you use from the cloud to do your data analysis are much faster than your personal computer.

Lastly, when you run software locally you constantly need to maintain them but making sure they're up and running and are up to date. You must download and install the newest version of the software or even pay for each new edition. Cloud storage and computing puts the responsibility on the service provider. Service providers make sure the software is well-maintained and is optimized.

# What are the disadvantegs?

Maybe the most obvious problem with cloud computing is that you always need interent connection to use storage and computing power from the cloud. 

There are also concerns with the privacy and security of your data stored remotely. There are two sides to the issue. One is concerned with cloud-based service providers and how they need to ensure the files stored at their data centers are safe and secure and the other is concerned with users and how they need to take authenticatin measures and strong passwords. Most of the main cloud-based service providers do a good job in securing your data and their infrastructure and you can easlity avoid security issues regarding your data by being serious about your choice of password and use two-level authentication.
