# Google Drive #

Google drive is a storage service. It enables us to store any documents (including images, videos, and documents) online. Also, it can help us do work together on the same documents or slides at the same time. You can edit and store slides and documents on Google Drive. To use Google Drive follow the steps below.

1. In Chrome go to [google drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
2. You will see picture like this

### Storage Limit ##

While Google Drive is generous in terms of how much space users have on the cloud compared to similar products, the amount of storage you get is not unlimited. Your free account comes with 15GB of storage. You have to pay for the service is 15GB is not enough: $1.99 per month buys you 100GB of storage and $9.99 (as of Februry 2018) buys you 1TB of storage. Note that this 15GB is shared among all Google services such as Gmail and Drive. So part of this storage may be used by your email attachments.

### Working Offline

The advantage of Google Drive is that all your files are stored online so they are more secure and are accessible whenever you want them. However, sometimes when you don't have access to the internet you may want to access your files offline. You can easily make Google Drive files available offline on your Chromebook. Follow these steps:

1. When online, install the [Google Docs Offline extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi) by clicking on Add to Chrome. (If the button says "Added to Chrome," you've already installed the extension.)

2. Go to [Google Drive settings](drive.google.com/drive/settings) and in the "Offline" area, check the box. It might take a few minutes for the offline access setting to turn on.

You can work on your files offline now. Any changes will sync to Google Drive the next time your Chromebook connects to the Internet.


### File Sharing

One of the best advantages of Google Drive is the ability to share files and folders. You can share the files and folders that you store in Google Drive with anyone using their email address (preferably their Gmail account). You can allow those people to edit, comment on, or only view the file. Editing gives more freedom to the person. They can change or even delete the file so be cautious. In order to share a file or folder right click on the file or folder and choose Share from the menu.

In the window that opens, enter the email address of the person you want to share the file/folder with and choose whether the person can edit, comment, or only view the content.

If for some reason you want to stop sharing a file/folder that you have already shared, right click on the file/folder and choose Share again. In the bottom right corner of the window that pops up, click on Advanced. There you'll see a list of people you've shared the files/folders with. On the right of each name/email there is a cross, <img src="./img/05_googledrive/07_cross.png" width="150">. By clicking on it, you will remove access of that person to the file/folder. Click Save changes at the end.


### Deleting Files

Deleting files on Google Drive is easy. On the web interface, right click on any file you would like to delete and choose Remove from the menu. You can delete multiple files or folders by selecting them all while holding the Ctrl key. Once selected, you can right click and remove them. 

### File Recovery

If you mistakenly delete a file or change your mind after deleting a file, recovering a removed file on Google Drive is easy. Simply click on Trash on the left-hand menu in the web interface.

In Trash you can see a list of all the files that you have previously removed. Then, right-click on the the file and select Restore.

If you're sure that you won't need the file forever, you can empty up some space by selecting the file(s)/folder(s) and clicking on Delete forever. By doing so your files will be deleted forever from your drive and can't be recovered. Use it with caution!

### Security and Two-Step Verification

Google Drive encrypts your data before storing it. Encryption is any method that converts data to to encoded version for security purposes. Drive is encrypted using SSL, the same security protocol used on Gmail and other Google services. However, you're responsible for securing your Google account. Our suggestion is to use Google's 2-step verification.

By using Two-Step Verification (also known as two-factor authentication), you add an extra layer of security to your account. This requires you to enter your password and on top of that enter a code that is sent to your phone or email. To set up two-step verification on your Google Account (which then applies to all Google products), go to [Two-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome) and select Get started and follow the step-by-step setup process.
