# Google Slides


## What is Google Slides?

One of the benefits to using Google Drive is its suite of document editors, completely free to use and accessible anywhere online. One of Drive's primary applications is the web-based slide presentation editor, Google Slides. Google Slides allows users to format and edit slide presentations. Other uers can edit the slides simultaneously. It is compatible with Microsoft Powerpoint files (.pptx and .ppt).

# Getting Started
Google Slides can be opened multiple ways. The simplest option for starting a new document is going to the Google Slides URL https://slides.google.com. Under "Start a new presentation" select the blank option or any of the templates available. 
![Google Slides Page](./img/08_googleslides/01_slidesstart.png)

Clicking on "TEMPLATE GALLERY" will expand the template options to include "Personal," "Work," and "Education" templates. If the template bar is not readily visible in the given URL, it can be enabled by clicking the top left menu button ![Docs Menu Button](./img/08_googleslides/02_template.png), and click on the checkbox under "Templates."

Assuming that you are logged into your Google account, underneath the templates you will see the past slide presentations that are saved on your Google Drive under the "Recent presentations." Each of them can be opened and edited by clicking on them, which will redirect the current window to the existing slide presentation. The options along the top will allow sorting by owner through a dropdown list ![ownership option](./img/08_googleslides/04_ownership.png), a list ![list view](./img/08_googleslides/05_listview.png) versus a grid view option ![grid view](./img/08_googleslides/06_gridview.png), sort by date modified or by title ![A-Z](./img/08_googleslides/07_AZview.png), or the file picker with search functionality ![File picker](./img/08_googleslides/08_filepicker.png). In addition, you can open slide presentations through Google Drive, either through going to the URL https://drive.google.com or opening your file manager and opening the Google Drive tab on the left hand menu.

# Guide to using Google Slides
One of the most convenient features of Google Drive and its applications is AutoSave. As soon as the application detects a change in the file, it will periodically save without any prompt from the user. No more worries about losing progress when the power goes out, the Internet disconnects, or even when a computer breaks down. Everything is on the Internet and saving autmoatically!

Google Slides is very similar to [Microsoft Powerpoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint). Most tasks that can be done in PowerPoint can also be done with Google Slides. From simple text addition and slide transitions to importing graphics and embedding [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos, all of this is possible in Google Slides. There are more in-depth guides on [adding images](https://www.gcflearnfree.org/googleslides/adding-pictures-and-shapes/1/), including [transitions and animations](https://www.gcflearnfree.org/googleslides/adding-transitions-and-animations/1/), and changing the [master template ](https://www.gcflearnfree.org/googleslides/editing-master-slides-and-layouts/1/) of your presentation.

If a stable internet connection is an issue or that plans have been made to work offline, Google Slides offers an offline mode that saves the word documents to the local computer. Even in offline mode, Google Slides will automatically save changes. 
To turn on offline mode:  
1. Go to the Google Slides [homepage](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/) 
2. Click on the menu button ![Slides Menu Button](./img/08_googleslides/02_template.png)
3. Click on "Settings"
4. Toggle the "Offline" switch to on   
![Offline mode on](./img/08_googleslides/11_offlinemode.png)
5. Offline mode for Slides will also be applied to Google Docs and Sheets.

# Creating a Great Presentation
To start creating a great presentation in Google Slides, a blank presentation can first be selected from the Google Slides URL https://slides.google.com and choosing to start a new Blank presentation ![new Blank presentation](./img/08_googleslides/01_slidesstart.png).

Clicking this will bring you to a new blank presentation.

From here you can begin to: 
* type in the dotted boxes to add text to your presentation
* add new slides to your presentation by clicking on the + sign ![top left-hand corner](./img/08_googleslides/13_addslide.png) in the top left-hand corner 
* add images to your slides by clicking on the ![image icon](./img/08_googleslides/14_addimage.png) image icon 
* view your presentation ![view your presentation](./img/08_googleslides/15_present.png) as a slideshow
* share your presentation with others using the ![share link](./img/08_googleslides/16_share.png) share link at the top-right 

As you prepare your presentation, it's best to keep a few guidelines in mind:
1. Minimize the number of words you put on any slide.
2. Whenever possible, use pictures instead of words.
3. Make sure images and text are as large as possible.
4. Use consistent text font and colors throughout slideshow.
