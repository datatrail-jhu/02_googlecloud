# Google Docs

One of the benefits to using Google Drive is its suite of document editors, completely free to use and accessible anywhere online. One of Drive's primary applications is the web-based word document and text editor, Google Docs, which allows users to format and edit word documents with other users simultaneously. It is compatible with Microsoft Word files (.docx and older) and text files (.txt).  

Google Docs can be opened in multiple ways. The simplest option for starting a new document is going to the Google Docs URL https://docs.google.com. Under "Start a new document" select the blank option or any of the templates available. 

![Google Docs Page](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-1.png)

Clicking on "TEMPLATE GALLERY" will expand the template options to include "Resumes," "Letters," "Personal," "Work," and "Education" templates. 

![Google Docs Templates Gallery](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-2.png)

Assuming that you are logged into your Google account, underneath the templates you will see the past documents that are saved on your Google Drive under the "Recent documents". Each of them can be opened and edited by clicking on them, which will redirect the current window to the old word document. You can sort by date modified or by title by clicking on the "A-Z" button.

In addition, you can open word documents through Google Drive, either through going to the URL https://drive.google.com or opening your file manager and opening the Google Drive tab on the left hand menu. Once in Google Drive, you can click on "New" and select "Google Docs" from the menu.

### Guide to using Google Docs

One of the most convenient features of Google Drive and its applications is its auto save. As soon as the application detects a change in the file, it will periodically save without any prompt from the user. No more worries about losing progress when the power goes out, the internet disconnects, or even when a computer breaks down. 

Google Docs operates very similarly to Microsoft Word without a couple of Word's more advanced features. However, most tasks can be done with Google Docs, from simple text editing to importing images and graphs to exporting documents as PDFs. There are more in-depth guides on [creating documents](https://www.gcflearnfree.org/googlespreadsheets/creating-google-docs/1/) and [downloading and printing](https://www.gcflearnfree.org/googlespreadsheets/converting-and-printing-docs/1/).

If a stable internet connection is an issue or if you plan to work offline, Google Docs offers an offline mode that saves the word documents to the local computer. Even in offline mode, Google Docs will automatically save changes.

To turn on offline mode:  

1. Go to Google Docs
2. Click on the menu button
3. Click on "Settings"

4. Toggle the "Offline" switch to on 

![Offline mode on](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-6.png)
Offline mode for Docs will also be applied to Google Sheets and Slides.

You can also download Google Docs documents in most common formats. You should click on "File" in the top menu and then select "Download as." You can then choose the format you want among the options including .pdf, .docx, .rtf, etc.

For sharing documents you can follow the procedure we learned in the lesson on Google Drive.

### Working in Google Docs

Now that we've covered how to access Google Docs, where to find Google Docs you've previously created, and how to download Google Docs, we'll discuss a few features that you can use within Google Docs. Additionally, many of these features can be used across Google products, so once you master them in Google Docs, you can also apply them in Google Sheets and Google Slides.

If you've worked in Google Docs or Microsoft Word previously, this will likely be a review. However, we want to make sure that all the features within Google Docs that you'll use regularly are covered in this lesson. To get started, again, you'll want to go to [https://docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com) and click on Blank to open up a blank document

![Blank Google Doc](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-9.png)

#### Formatting Font

Within Google Docs, once you start typing information into your document, you may want to change the way that your text looks. This is called "formatting" your text. You can format the text by:

* changing the font
* changing the size of the font
* making the font bold, italicized, or underlined
* changing the color of the font

All of these changes to text can be accomplished using the options on the toolbar within Google Docs.

![Formatting from the toolbar in Google Docs](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-10.png)

To use these options from the toolbar, you'll begin typing within Google Docs. Then, for any text you want to format, you will simply highlight the text, and click on the appropriate option from the toolbar. In this example, we would type "Document Title" into the Google Doc.

To make the title bold, underlined, and larger, we would just highlight the text, click on the bold symbol and the underline symbol. While the text is still highlighted you would click on the drop down "Font size" menu, and click on a larger number (here, we've selected '24'). Now your text will be just as you want it. The same process can be used to change the font and to change the color of the font.

![Formatted title within Google Docs](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-16.png)

#### Aligning Text

What if, in addition to formatting the text itself you wanted to alter where the text was on the page? To change this, you can use other options from the toolbar. These buttons can be used to alter the alignment in four different ways:

* left-aligned - aligned on the left side of the page
* center-aligned - aligned in the center of the page
* right-aligned - aligned on the right side of the page
* justified - aligned so that the text is flush with both the left- and right-sides of the page

To use these options, again, you'll highlight the text you would like to align and then click on the appropriate alignment option:

![different alignment options within Google Doc](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-18.png)

#### Inserting a List

In addition to changing how some text is formatted or where it is on the page, you'll often find the need to include lists in your Google Docs. There are two primary types of lists in documents:

* bulleted lists - lists where each item starts with a bullet
* numbered lists - lists where each item starts with a number

To create either type of list, you can type the list out, with each item on a separate line. You'll then highlight the text you want to be a list, and click on either the numbered list icon in the toolbar or the bulleted list icon in the toolbar to create the type of list you want to create.

![options to create a numbered or bulleted list](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-23.png)

#### Inserting an Image

We previously covered this briefly; however, we'll cover how to insert an image into your Google Doc in more detail now. 

To insert an image, you'll make sure the cursor is in your document where you would like to insert the image, and then you'll click on the insert an image icon in the toolbar to display a drop-down menu with options:

![Insert an image icon](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-24.png)

There are a number of ways in which you can insert an image that will appear on this menu. Most frequently, you'll likely be including images that are either on your computer or from a URL. We'll discuss those in detail now, but feel free to play around with the other options to understand them as well.

##### From a URL

If there's an image on the Internet that you would like to insert into your Google Doc, Google makes this simple for you. For example if you were on Google and searched for "R language image", you'd likely get results looking something similar to this:

![R language image search](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-25.png)

If you were to click on 'Images for R language', you'd see lots of images from which to choose. If you were to scroll through these, you could select your favorite image, and two-finger click on it. 

![Google Image search](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-27.png)

From the drop-down menu, click on "Copy Image Address." This copies the image address (the URL) for this image. This enables you to paste it in your Google Doc.

!["Copy Image Address" menu](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-28.png)

You would then return to your Google Doc, ensure that your cursor is where you would like to insert the image and click on the image icon in the toolbar, and select "By URL" from the drop-down menu 

![Insert Image icon and select "By URL"](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-29.png)

In the box that pops up, you'll then paste the URL that you just copied by using the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + v`. 

![Insert image by pasting URL](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-30.png)

The image you selected will automatically appear in that box. Now, you just have to click "INSERT."

![Click INSERT to insert image](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-31.png)

The image will now appear in your Google Doc!

![image inserted in Google Doc from URL](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-32.png)

Whenever you're using an image that is not your own, whether in a Google Doc, a Google Sheet presentation, or anywhere else, it's important to include the source information, to give credit to the people whose image it is and to allow others to find the image if they want to.

![image inserted in Google Doc from URL with source](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-33.png)

Note: If an image you select does not work with these instructions, there is a chance that you do not have permission to use that image. In that case, it's likely best to search for an alternate image. 


##### From your computer

In addition to inserting images from URL, you may need to insert images that are on your computer locally. We previously discussed that there is not much local storage on your Chromebook; however, if you have saved an image to that space, you can insert it in your Google Doc using the following procedure. 


First, you'll click on Insert Image Icon and click on the "Upload from computer" from the drop-down menu. On your Chromebook, this will give you access to your Downloads folder. 

![Select "Upload from computer"](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-34.png)

If the file you want to insert has been recently downloaded, it will appear first in the list that appears. Click on the image you want to insert and then click "OPEN" at the bottom right-hand of the screen.

![Select image from Downloads in Documents that appear](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-35.png)

Your image will now be inserted in your Google Doc! As mentioned in the previous section, don't forget to include your source!

![Image inserted from computer](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-36.png)

#### Inserting a Table

In addition to inserting lists and images, you may find the need to insert tables into your Google Docs. To do so, you'll make sure your cursor is in your Google Doc where you'd like to insert the table and then click on "Insert" from the menu along the top of your Google Doc. From the drop-down menu, you'll click on Table. 

![Insert table](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-37.png)

This will expose an additional menu from which you'll select how many columns and rows you want the table to have. For example, if you want a table with 4 columns and two rows, you'll highlight that in the squares that pop up and click once.

![Insert table using highlighted cells](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-38.png)

With that, a 4x2 (meaning 4 columns and 2 rows) will be inserted in your document.

![table inserted within a Google Doc](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-39.png)

You can then click in the squares of the table to add text to your table. Note that all of the formatting discussed earlier in this lesson still applies within a table. You can change the font, font size, and color of text within a table.
  
Finally, to change additional things within your table, you can always put your cursor in the table, two-finger click to expose a drop-down menu, and make a selection from that list. If you need additional columns or rows or to delete columns or rows, that can be accomplished in this manner.

![Additional table options can be accessed by two-finger clicking within a table](images/05_docs/05_google_docs-40.png)

### Renaming Your Document

Finally, "Untitled document" is not a great name for your Google Doc. To change the name of your document, simply click in the "Untitled document" box at the top of the Google Doc and type in what you would like your filename to be. We'll cover how to best name files in a later course; however, for now, make sure you change the name of your Google Docs to something more informative than "Untitled document", and very briefly, it's best not to use spaces in your filenames but rather to use an underscore anywhere you would otherwise put a space.
