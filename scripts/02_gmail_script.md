Gmail is a free e-mail service provided by Google that provides users with a gigabyte of storage for messages and provides the ability to search for specific emails. Gmail also automatically organizes related emails into a conversational thread.

You can access Gmail by going to the address www.gmail.com or by clicking on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner and searching for "Gmail". If you are not already logged into your gmail account, you will see a screen similar to the one down below.

After inputting your email and password you will be able to see your inbox.

Let's say you want to send an email. You can send and email by first pressing the "Compose" button on the top left corner. A box will pop-up where you can enter the recipient, subject, and content of the email. There are a few buttons at the buttom of the email box that are very helpful. 

First, you can attach a file (such as an image, a document, or a video) to your email by clicking on the attachment sign and choosing the file from your computer.

You can also choose files from your Google Drive folder. Google Drive is Google's file hosting service and we will learn about that soon. But for now, you can eastily attach a file that is hosted on your Google Drive to any email.

Other options include inserting a photo, inserting a link, emojis, or even sending money through your email. If you type an email but change your mind and you want to delete the email, you can discard the email by clicking on the trash can in the corner of the composing screen.

Note that you can send an email to multiple people by entering all the emails one after another in from of To. Or you could add them in the Cc or Bcc fileds. If you enter an email in the Bcc filed, they won't see other emails that are also in the Bcc field.

After you are done writing your email just press the "Send" button and you are done!

To reply to an email, first find the email on your inbox and click on it. Scroll all the way down the email until you find a box similar to the one below and simply just click on it. After writing your response to the email click the send button and you are done! Remember also that you can reply all to an email which means your email will be sent to all the people who were on the original email. Use this option with caution.

To find emails in your inbox you can type on the search box the subject of the email, the name of the person who sent the email, or the content of the email. The search box looks like the image below and is located at the top of the screen.
